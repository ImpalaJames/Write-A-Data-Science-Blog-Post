## Project Motivation
This project is included as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

Boston Airbnb Dataset is analyzed in this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

For this project, I was interested in using the data to better understand: 
1. What are the most common amenities in the listings?
2. What attracts the guests most for renting a property?
3. What are the most influencial features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?
4. What is the impact of listings' proximity to Seattle Downtown in terms of price?

## File Descriptions
1. Original dataset listings.csv  in csv format
2. Boston Airbnb Dataset.ipynb Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations



## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. matplotlib.pyplot
5. Seaborn
6. Collections
